# GEN-SCRAPER

# 1. Introduction


In the digital age, online reviews play a pivotal role in influencing consumer decisions. With the rise of AI-generated content, it has become increasingly challenging to distinguish between genuine and synthetic reviews. GEN-SCRAPER aims to address this issue by scraping Amazon reviews for a given product and analyzing the proportion of AI-generated content to ensure review originality.

# 2. Aim
The primary objective of GEN-SCRAPER is to develop a tool that can scrape reviews from Amazon product pages and analyze them to determine the likelihood of being generated by AI. This helps in assessing the authenticity of online reviews and providing consumers with more reliable information.

# 3. Data Description
The dataset used for training the AI detection model consists of labeled reviews, with categories distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated content. The dataset contains the following columns:
text: The text of the review.
label: The label indicating whether the review is written by a human or generated by AI.

# 4. Data preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Label Encoding: Converting the label column to binary classes where AI-generated reviews are labeled as "ai" and human-written reviews are labeled as "human".
Data Shuffling: Shuffling the dataset to ensure a random distribution of data points for training and testing.

# 5. Methodology

The proposed system consists of two main components: 

1. Model Training

Vectorization: Using TfidfVectorizer to convert review texts into numerical feature vectors.
Model Selection: An ExtraTreesClassifier is chosen for its robustness and effectiveness in handling text data.
Training and Validation: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, followed by training the classifier and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
Model Saving: Saving the trained model and vectorizer for later use.

2. Review Scraping and Analysis

Setup Selenium WebDriver: The Selenium WebDriver is configured to run in headless mode, enabling automated browser interactions without a GUI.
Scrape Amazon Reviews: The WebDriver navigates to the specified Amazon product page and extracts the review texts.
Load Pre-trained Model: The pre-trained model and vectorizer are loaded to analyze the scraped reviews.
Analyze Reviews: Each review is analyzed by the model to determine whether it is likely AI-generated or human-written.



# 6. Results

The model achieved an accuracy and f1 scores of 89.14% and 89.47% respectively. The model was deployed with a streamlit frontend for ease of usage for the layman.


# Conclusion

GEN-SCRAPER effectively scrapes and analyzes Amazon reviews to identify AI-generated content. The project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning models to enhance the reliability of online reviews. This tool can significantly aid consumers in making informed decisions by providing insights into the authenticity of product reviews.
